# ==========
# First, we'll try to detect your OS...
# If you're on a Mac, homebrew will be installed (if you already have Homebrew +
#   stow or git, don't worry .. things won't get installed again)

# If you're on Linux, we'll detect your distro & attempt to use your distro's
#   default package manager to install the stow & git

# Finally, we'll use stow to create the appropriate symlinks
# If you decide there were some things that you don't want/need that were
# linked, you can delete it from your HOME directory ..
#   TIP: view symlinks with `ls -la` in your HOME directory, the proceed to
#   remove the link: `rm <link>`
